Hello,

This is just a reminder that you registered for an account at hcesbuses.com on <%= @user.created_at.strftime("%B %-d, %Y") %>, but never finished setting it up. In order to really be sure that it's you setting up the account under your email, we require that you click on a confirmation link in an email before activating your account.

It's quite possible that the confirmation email went to your junk mail folder, or you otherwise missed it. That's ok, though - this email reminder also contains the link that you'll need to activate your account, and then get to bus-watching!

To confirm your account right now, just follow this link:

http://hcesbuses.com/users/confirmation?confirmation_token=<%= @user.confirmation_token %>

If you no longer want to use HCESBuses.com, just reply back to me and I'll delete your account, so that you don't get bothered any more!

Thank you,

H. Wade Minter
