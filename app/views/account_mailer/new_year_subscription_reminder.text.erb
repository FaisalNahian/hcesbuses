Hello,

It's a new school year at Harris Creek Elementary School! That's why we're sending out this automated reminder to all HCESBuses.com users. The new year-round schedule is in our system, ready to go to keep you up to date on when the buses leave in the afternoon.

However, we know that some of you may no longer need these notifications. Maybe your child has moved on to middle school, maybe you've moved to a different school. Some may have changed tracks. Others may not have been to our website in a while, and just need a reminder about what bus you're watching.

That's why we're sending you this reminder - here is a list of the bus (or buses) that you're watching as of right now:

<%= @user.trackers.each do |tracker| %>
* <%= tracker.bus %> - Track <%= tracker.track %> <%= "(Inactive") unless tracker.active %>
<% end %>

The cell phone number(s) that you have configured in our system are:

<%= @user.mobile_phones.each do |phone| %>
* <%= number_to_phone(phone.number) %> on <%= SMSFu.carrier_name(phone.carrier) %>
<% end %>

If that's all still correct, you're set! Nothing at all to change!

If you need to update your information, or want to delete your account, visit http://hcesbuses.com/, log in, and update what's needed. For account deletions, go under "Your Account", choose "Edit/Delete Account", and click the big orange "Remove My Account" button.

And if you have any questions, just reply to this email and I'll be glad to help.

Thanks,
